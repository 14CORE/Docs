3. Unzip the libraries and put them in the /Processing/libraries/ folder.
4. Download the OpenBCI_Processing Github Repository:
`git clone https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_Processing.git`

### 4. Headware Setup

1. Apply electrode paste to the 3 electrodes. Make sure to add enough paste so that it forms a convex shape on the electrode cavity, allowing for a strong seal with the skin.
2. Connect 1 ground electrode (typically to the mastoid behind the ear)
3. Connect 1 reference electrode to the earlobe
4. Connect 1 EEG channel electrode (any location on the head from where you want to sample EEG)

### 5. Test It

1. Open the file OpenBCI_GUI.pde in Processing and run the program.
2. Select your serial/COM port in the left hand menu and click Initialize System.
3. If for some reason, the brainwaves don't start streaming, switch your OpenBCI board to Off and then back to "PC", and redo the previous step.
4. Click into the main interface and press Tab to change to Channel settings.
5. De-select every channel but the one your EEG channel electrode is connected to, which will be Channel 1 if you connected it to the N1P pin.
6. If all goes as it should, you should see your brainwaves streaming out.
7. Play with the controls to get a feel for different ways to view the data.
8. Blink your eyes, grit your teeth, play around with it!
