# Custom Widgets

This tutorial shows you how to create your own custom widgets for the [OpenBCI GUI](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_GUI). In just a few easy steps you can have your own mini applications added to the dropdown menus of the OpenBCI GUI for running specialized applications in real-time. These widgets can tap directly into the main data structure of the OpenBCI GUI, so you can experiment with brain waves and other bio data right in the GUI.
