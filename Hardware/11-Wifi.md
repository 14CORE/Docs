# OpenBCI Wifi

The OpenBCI Wifi PCB was designed with KiCAD, an Open Source PCB capture software. You can find a link to download KiCAD in our [OpenBCI design files repository](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_Wifi_Shield) where you will find design files and component library files to load into KiCAD and edit, if you like, along with the full BOM for this maiden production run.
